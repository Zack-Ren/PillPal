# PillPal
### Motivation
When I used to work as a pharamcist assistant, I noticed there was an issue with patient compliance. Patients can often find it difficult to remember when and how to take their medication. PillPal aims to address this. PillPal is a mobile application allowing patients to  safelt and conveniently store their medication data. The patient will be given a reminder when it's time to take another dosage of their medication.

PillPal is current a work in progress
